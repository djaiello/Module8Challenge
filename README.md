# Crowdfunding ETL Project Module Challenge

## Purpose
  The company received a new dataset that contains information about the backers whoâ€™ve pledged to the live projects and they want  it processed using ETL to add the data to the existing database. In addition, they want a data analysis performed by using SQL queries to determine the number of backers for each "live" campaign, and to make contact with backers providing information on the outstanding goal amounts.
